# BitLeandor

This is a rewrite to my old chess engine which can be found [here](https://www.github.com/FeudMe/ChessEngineVS). 

It is an attempt to use magic bitboards for bord representation to speed up move generation and evaluation.
Till now, it is still weaker than my old program.  

The Koivisto Discord server has been an invaluable resource. 
Also the Koivisto project on Github often served as guide and inspiration for efficient implementations of various features (e.g. Movegen).
